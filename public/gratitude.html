      <h1><i>Thank you for making this journey</i> ☁</h1>
      <p class="thank-you">
        The journey you've made is inspired by how secure rendezvous points are established in the Tor network to allow websites to be visited and hosted anonymously.
      </p>
      <p class="thank-you">
        As a technologist and general internet user, this process fills me with such awe and wonder. I like to think about it as being able to send a letter to someone (and receive a response!) without knowing their mailing address or revealing mine.
      </p>
      <p class="thank-you">
        In a web that's increasingly surveilled, extractive, and monopolized, this kind of network communication that's built on open-source tools, designed with privacy, and supported by volunteers around the world presents a counter-narrative.
        <!-- Say more? A counter-vision? An alternative vision? -->
        <!-- Counter-narrative to common talking points that anonymity on the internet is inherently toxic, that you're the product if you're using services for free, ... -->
      </p>
      <p class="thank-you">
         <!-- As Alexis Shotwell says in <i>Against Purity</i>... Contesting the past -->
         Learning about how systems like Tor operate helps me contest the logic and inevitability of technologies that we have. Connection and intimacy do come in many forms. I'm finding more and more of it through anonymity these days.
